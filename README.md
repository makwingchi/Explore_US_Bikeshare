# Explore_US_Bikeshare

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC. I wrote code to import the data and computed descriptive statistics. This creates an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
